Be on your own journey. Embrace it, accept the unknowns. Figure things out yourself. Find out what you, and only you, like. And for once, imagine a world where you are the only person. Now, how would you survive? There's not even tutorial hell to cope with.. Observe. Write down what you see. Reflect. Make mistakes (important!). Iterate. Trust where your gut instincts will take you. In this age, with the amount of successful people you see, with the information you are bombarded with every second, you might feel that there can't be any room for error. But the truth is, there is no other way. Following others' journey will only help/inspire you to a certain extent. Everything else happens on its own. In your life. And if you don't push past this phase, how will you ever reach there? You can never be worthy of the good things in life if you have never done the dirty work. Remove that crutch of "other people". Be the engineer. Be the designer. Of you.
